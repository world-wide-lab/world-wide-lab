# Downloading the Desktop App

The World-Wide-Lab Desktop App is a standalone application that allows you to run World-Wide-App on your local machine. This is useful for testing your studies before deploying them online or for running studies offline.

It also comes with support for deploying World-Wide-Lab to the cloud through a graphical UI.

⚠️ While the Desktop App is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, it's only tested on Mac so far. If you encounter any issues on Windows or Linux, please let us know by opening an issue on GitHub or sending us an email.
