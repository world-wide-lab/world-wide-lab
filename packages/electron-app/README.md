# World-Wide-Lab: Self-Contained App

Desktop application which contains everything to use World-Wide-Lab on your own computer to try it out and run local studies.

If you want to use the app straight-away, we suggest using a pre-built version of the application. The following sections are only relevant if you wish to build the app from sratch e.g. for developing new features.

## Development

Before running any of the scripts below, you will need to install the dependencies for both, this package (`electron-app`) and the server itself (`wwl`). You can do this by running `npm install` in each of the two directories.
