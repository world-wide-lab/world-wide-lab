# World-Wide-Lab: Deployment Helper

This package contains examples and code for deploying World-Wide-Lab to the cloud. For now, we only have code for deploying to the AWS. However, you can deploy World-Wide-Lab to any cloud provider you want and we plan to add guidance for deploying to other cloud providers in the future.

Please refer to the [jsPsych deployment guide](/docs/guides/deploy.md) in the documentation for more information.
