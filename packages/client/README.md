# World-Wide-Lab: Client

A small package to make it easier to use the World-Wide-Lab API in your own study or to store some custom data in World-Wide-Lab. If you use one of the libraries with a supported integration package, you will most probably not need this package.

Please refer to the [client guide](https://worldwidelab.org/guides/client.md) in the documentation for more information.
