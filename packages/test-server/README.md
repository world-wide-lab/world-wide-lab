# World-Wide-Lab: Server Tester

This is a minimal package used to test a running [World-Wide-Lab server](../server/).

Typically this package is used to test a `world-wide-lab/server` docker container.

If you do not plan to develop on the World-Wide-Lab server you will usually not need this package.
