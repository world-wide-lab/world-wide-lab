# World-Wide-Lab: jsPsych Integration

This package provides a simple integration of World-Wide-Lab for [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/). The package makes it easy to either automatically store all data from any experiment running in jsPsych or use it in a more fine-grained fashion to store exactly the data you want.
